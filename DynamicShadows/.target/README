*** AUDIORACE ***   

1. DESCRIPTION
==============
Audiorace is a music based game similar to the popular 'Audiosurf'.
It analyzes the songs of your choice and creates a unique track to ride on.
The goal of the game is simple but encouraging: choose your song and beat your
own hiscore!

That you're able to start immediately, I've added 3 songs which are released
under creative commons licenses. These are 2 from Nine Inch Nails (1000000 
and Discipline) and 1 from a german band called Pornophonique (Space Invaders).


2. IMPORTANT NOTE
=================
I've programmed this game using firmware 1.1.0 and did all my tests using this
version! As opengles lib i use the one from the 1.2.0 firmware because it seems
it has some good optimizations in it.
If it doesnt start you might try another opengles lib first by copying the files
from the Libs/ subfolder to the game's folder. 
Try http://dl.openhandhelds.org/cgi-bin/wiz.cgi if you can't find a working one.  


3. HOW TO ADD SONGS
===================
If you're not happy with my song selection, you can of course add songs of your
choice! It's simple: just copy some music into the Music/ subdirectory (or any
other folder, a browser is included).
Audiorace will analyze the song the first time it is played (sorry, this may 
take some time,  FFT is used!) and saves the result for later reuse.

At the moment only OGG files are supported!!! Don't want to get in the hell
with all that MP3 licensing issues...

I recommend 44khz encoded files. I've tried different stereos with songlengths 
from 3 upto 5 minutes and they worked fine for me. But you never know... 
                                                                 
4. CONTROLS
===========
The controls are explained within the game. Each part of the game has it's own
help screen which can be shown (and hidden again) by pressing the left shoulder
button.
Volume buttons control the volume of course.

8. THANKS
===========
Thanks fly out to everyone at the gp32x.com forum, notably lorgy77 for
organizing PACC - without the compo this game wouldn't exist.
 
I'd also like to thank acegraph for creating the oustanding graphics.
Without him it would look like a piece of sh*t (i mean, "programmer's art" ;))

And last but not least, thanks to my GF, who had some tough time with me while I
was making this, but has 'survived' it! :)
